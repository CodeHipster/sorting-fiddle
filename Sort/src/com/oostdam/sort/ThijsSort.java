/**
 * Created by Thijs on 3/12/2016.
 * Sort the way one would do it manually.
 * grab items from the front and place them in a position where they belong in the new set.
 * Hard part is to find the place to insert. Have anchor points or some middle, middle of middle etc structure to follow.
 * Multithread: splitting the unsorted set in multiple sets which are sorted on their own thread and merged when done.
